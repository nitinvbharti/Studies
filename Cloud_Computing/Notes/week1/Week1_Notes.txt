* Cloud Computing:

Defn.: Storage + Compute Cycles 

Features:
1. Massive Scale 
2. On-Demand Access: 
	- Pay as you go
	- Anyone can access it anytime
3. Data Intensive nature
4. New Cloud computing paradigms: 
	- MapReduce(Google)/Hadoop
	- NoSQL, Cassandra, MongoDB

For a new problem to solve any of these problems must be present or else the soultion to the problem already exists.

* On-Demand Access:  "*aaS Classifications"

1. HaaS: Hardware as a service
	- Access to barebone hardware machines 
	- Use for whatever purpose needed. eg. Clusters 
2. IaaS: Infrastructure as a service
	- Flexible computing and storage infrastructures as VMs
	- AWS(EC2:Elastic compute cloud, S3 : Simple Storage Service), MS Azure
3. PaaS: Platform as a Service
	- A form of IaaS
	- No access to VM directly, but can write code and integrate to sotftware platform
	- Google's App Engine
4. SaaS: Software as a Service
	- Access to software services when needed
	- Google Docs, MS Office 365 etc.

* Data-Intensive Computing:
1. Computation Intensive uses fair amount of data but high amount of computations on data.
2. Data Intensive stores huge amopunt of data at data centres and has compute node nearby which is used for computations on the data

* Distributed System:

Defn.: A distributed system, this definition says, is a distributed system is a collection of entities, each of these entities being autonomous, programmable, asynchronous and failure-prone, and these entities communicate through an unreliable(delayed, lost updates) communication medium.

- In a distributed system 1000's of processes are running simultaneously and communicating with each other. 

- Cloud is a distributed System.
- Server comminicate with each other
- Server communitcate with client and vice versa
- Client communicate with each others (BitTorrent)
